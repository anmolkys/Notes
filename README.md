# Notes in React

Notes app made in React JS and deployed using gh-pages . Been learning React for a while now so wanted to make a project that would test it's core concepts .

It can save the notes locally in a device 



## Features to Add

- Deletion feature : Kind of got stuck in it

- Firebase integration to store notes in user accounts
